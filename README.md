# Professional-README-Generator
    
## Description
    This challenge was an excerise in Node and Javascript usage. I started with a brief Javascript document, describing some of the key elements needed to set up an integratiive Javascript framework with Node elements. The task was to deploy Node in the integrated terminal to prompt the user. At the end of the user prompts, a README document should be generated for the user in markdown. In order to start this process, I first had to install inquirer 8.2.4 in the integrated terminal. Next, I set up a prompt selection and logged the prompts to a shell markdown README template. I included spaces for links as well as descriptions.

    The finished product allows the user access to a README generator and is useful for future developers, including myself. Now, instead of copying and pasting a README template, I can enter my information directly into the document.
